 (I just saw a comment 1 min ago from a previous submission to add a screenshot in my README file, I will look into how to do that for next submission.)

This assignment was a great learning experience, I had fun with it! I styled the pages a little differently from the examples shown to us, I hope that's ok. 

There's a few nits I would love to spend more time on refining, I'm hoping you don't even notice! It may be things that I notice just because I come from the design field. 

Looking foward to feedback to learn better ways to execute this.
